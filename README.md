Running the program and again choosing option 3 could look like the following, where
this time we increase the number of spaces between the letters, which has the effect
of also increasing the length of the lines at the top and bottom.

			Go Flames! Choose from among the following options:
			   1. Display U I C as horizontal block letters
			   2. Display U I C as vertical block letters
			   3. Display U I C as an animation
			   4. Exit the program
			Your choice -> 3

			Clear the screen between displays? (Y/N) -> n
			How many sets of letters? -> 4
			How many blanks between letters (0..30)? -> 5
